**Scalable Detection of Rural Schools in Africa using CNNs and Satellite Imagery (2018-2020)**
- This San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) project aims to detect undocumented schools in Africa by analyzing satellite maps, in order to help the UNICEF provide suitable aid to African children.
- Responsible for a large part of the code base for the project
- Wrote the main satellite data processing pipeline. reimplementing certain components from earlier concept modules
- Wrote and improved an automatic experimentation pipeline that drastically accelerated project development
- Built testbed systems for deploying trained models for field use
- Managed project databases and software systems

**Automatic LVEF Calculation from Cardial Imagery (2019-2020)**
- This joint project between the UCSD Computer Science and Engineering department and SDSC aims to automate calculations of the left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an important cardiac disease predictor, from cardiac MRI images.
- Lead one of several development branches, focusing on recurrent neural networks, in particular the Gamma-Net architecture by Linsley et al. (2019). 
- Reimplemented the Gamma-Net architecture, a very complex system of neural network models, from TensorFlow to PyTorch
- Designed and managed a large number of neural network experiments in order to improve model performance
- Published results as my master's thesis

**Understanding a Rapidly Expanding Refugee Camp Using CNNs and Satellite Imagery (2019)**
- A joint project between the UCSD School of Global Policy and Strategy and the San Diego Supercomputer center. The project analyzes satellite imagery of the Kutupalong (Rohingya) refugee camp in Bangladesh to uncover the condition of the site and its populace. 
- Applied a modified pipeline from the UNICEF project and coupled it with multi-staged K-Means, to adapt the system for analyzing changes in the refugee camp over time.
- Refined the image analysis system to be production-ready
- Provided on- and off-site support for project personnel

**Land Cover Analysis (2019)**
- An SDSC project that aims to provide a detailed land cover map of southern California, identifying the type of terrain at each point on the map. This provides state officials with crucial information pertaining to wildfire prevention and protection.
- Participated in algorithm design
- Proposed several alternatives to existing approaches to enhancing existing, low-resolution land cover data
- Implemented components of a testbed system for research use
- Managed project databases and software systems

**WiFire: Predicting Santa-Ana Weather Conditions Using Distributed Weather Station Data (2017)**
- The WiFire project aims to provide an end-to-end, real-time monitoring and prediction engine for Santa-Ana weather conditions in southern California. Santa-Ana weather conditions are known to be a high-risk cause of destructive wildfires in the area. 
- Wrote part of the main data pipeline in the real-time data processing system
- Developed key algorithms which automatically classify and analyze weather pattern clusters
- Wrote part of the automation framework for data processing

**Personal Machine Learning Projects**
- iMGNE: an LSTM-based piano pattern learner operating in the audio frequency domain
- Retinal pathology analysis using Inception, ResNet and ResNEXT architectures
- Experiments on content-addressable memory models based on Hopfield nets

**Other Projects**
- Various microcontroller-based projects using AVR and ARM chips, including robots for different purposes, radio message transceivers, flight sim dashbords, RTOS-based multitasking handheld teminals, and custom lightsabers
- Fiction writing, drawing, poetry
