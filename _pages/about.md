Hi, this is Jiaxin (Jason) Li. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student of the Intelligent Systems Program at the University of Pittsburgh, studying under Professor Michael Lewis (Informatics and Distributed Systems and Intelligent Systems Program). My primary area of interest is human cognition and artificial interlligence, in particular recurrent neural nerwork models. I also paddle around in control systems and robotics. 

My previous work include aspects of neural network research, development and application, high performance computing, and systems development for a few publicly or privately funded projects. Most of this work I did while working for the San Diego Supercomputer Center as a student researcher. I also worked on several projects with the Computer Science and Engineering department and the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California, San Diego.
